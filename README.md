### Description

Every time I look at the Mandelbrot Set I am amazed by it. So I decided to make an application to view it. I ended up making a screen saver out of it. It generates an image and then zooms in around the edges. The screen saver must be compiled to use due to the rules against uploading applications and dlls. Steps to compile are included (basically compiling an exe but with a .scr extension.
